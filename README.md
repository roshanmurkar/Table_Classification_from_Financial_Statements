# Table_Classification_from_Financial_Statements


### Project Objective:
The primary goal of the project is to develop a system that can efficiently classify tables from financial statements into predefined categories. By automating this process, the project aims to streamline the analysis of financial data, improve data organization, and facilitate decision-making processes.

### Key Components:

1. Data Extraction: The project involves extracting tables from HTML files containing financial statements. This is achieved using BeautifulSoup, a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.

2. Data Categorization: Tables are categorized into specific financial statement types such as Income Statements, Balance Sheets, Cash Flows, and Notes. Additionally, there is a category for "Others" to capture tables that do not fit into the primary categories.

3. Feature Engineering: The text data extracted from tables is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. This step prepares the data for machine learning classification algorithms.

4. Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the labeled data to learn patterns and relationships between the features and their corresponding categories.

5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its accuracy and performance in classifying tables into the correct categories.

6. Scalability and Adaptability: The project is designed to be scalable and adaptable to accommodate new data sources or changes in the classification criteria. It includes a function for preprocessing and predicting on new test data, enabling the system to handle additional data seamlessly.

### Potential Applications:

1. Financial Analysis Tools: The automated classification system can be integrated into financial analysis tools to assist analysts in quickly identifying and analyzing relevant data from financial statements.

2. Regulatory Compliance: It can aid in compliance efforts by accurately categorizing financial data according to regulatory requirements and standards.

3. Investment Decision Support: Investors and financial institutions can use the system to process large volumes of financial data efficiently, helping them make informed investment decisions.

4. Risk Management: By organizing financial data effectively, the system can support risk management activities by identifying potential risks and vulnerabilities in financial statements.

### Future Enhancements:

1. Fine-Tuning Model: Continuously fine-tuning the classification model with new data to improve accuracy and adaptability.

2. Integration with Data Pipelines: Integrating the system with data pipelines to automate the extraction, classification, and analysis of financial data in real-time.

3. User Interface Development: Creating a user-friendly interface for easy access and interaction with the classification system.
